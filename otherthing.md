# Equality, Equivalence, and Enemies
## On the Metaphysics of Liberalism

On May 13, 2016 The New Yorker published an article ‘The
Maoism of Donald Trump’ written by Jiayang Fan. Opening 
with a picture of Trump center-stage with his left hand 
raised in a Nazi-esque salute to his audience, Fan thus 
frames the discussion of the relation between Trump and 
Mao. This relation is one of abstract equivalence, with 
the specter of Hitler and Nazism just an associative leap 
away, but never explicitly written. Through the twin 
operations of abstraction and equivalence Fan works to 
create a narrative of how Trump is no different than Mao,
and leaves her readers to imagine the horrors that would 
follow if Trump were to be elected. The discourse of 
liberalism posits a metaphysical opposition between 
(western parliamentary) democracy and totalitarianism --which
in this article is 'China's socialist plutocracy'-- and
holds that the ultimate measure of the evil of a ruler is the 
death count that can be attributed to his personage. Within this 
framework, what is Hitler’s ten million person holocaust compared to
the thirty-eight million that Mao supposedly killed between 1958-1961
alone!1 The lens of abstract equivalence makes it appear that, 
even worse than another Hitler, would be another Mao. But all 
of this is perhaps premature. First it is necessary to inquire,
how does Fan’s article, devoid of any direct references to death
counts (perhaps because, at present, none are attributable to Trump), 
justify the comparative equivalence between Trump and Mao? 

### 1) Difference, Contradiction, and Dualism

Fan opens her article with a discussion of Mao’s ‘worldview’ 
as he elaborates on it his 1957 speech 'On the Correct Handling 
of Contradictions Among the People'. In re-presenting Mao’s 
position Fan states that the former ‘drew a distinction between
“the people” and “the enemy.” The people were effectively the 
in-group, while the enemy was nothing but a collection of 
demons and thugs to be vigilantly resisted.’  In Fan’s view such
a distinction between the people and the enemy is part of ‘the us-versus-them 
dichotomy,’ which was, ‘a cornerstone of Maoism’ and 
‘effectively painted the world in black and white, banishing 
diversity, difference, or considerations of civil liberty.’ 

The crux of Fan’s argument hinges on this reductive re-presentation
of Mao’s theory of contradictions (in this case between the people
and the enemy) to a static dualism of ‘us-versus-them’. According to 
her, such a reduction of the complexity of the world is also present
in Trump’s campaign for presidency. In fact, this similarity 
functions as Fan’s basis for the comparison of Trump and Mao. As she puts it
'that worldview [of Maoism] has found curious potency sixty-odd 
years later in the mouth of another bombastic demagogue, reared in 
a wholly different political system, who shares Mao’s knack for 
polemical excess and xenophobic paranoia.' Thus without doing more
than referencing the title of a speech by Mao and without quoting Trump, Fan
makes the claim that Mao's worldview has 'found curious potency'
in Trump's mouth. The lack of any concrete comparison between
what the two have said is indicative of the general 
degree of abstraction that is necessary to sustain such an equivalence.

Through abstracting Fan can claim that Trump's 'polemical excess and
xenophobic paranoia' (presumably followed with grotesque fascination by 
the readers of The New Yorker) has its origin in Mao's speech 'On the
Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'. After reading
Fan's article, one would expect to find in Mao's speech a 'polemical
excess' which supports Fan's claim that 'the people were effectively 
the in-group, while the enemy was nothing but a collection of demons 
and thugs to be vigilantly resisted.' Yet, if one actually investigates
it becomes clear that Fan has taken great liberties in her re-presentation
of Mao's speech, and his 'worldview' in general. For example, Mao articulates
that 'the concept of "the people" varies in content in different countries 
and in different periods of history in a given country,' and goes on to 
state that 'in the conditions prevailing in China today, the contradictions 
among the people comprise the contradictions within the working class, 
the contradictions within the peasantry, the contradictions within the 
intelligentsia, the contradictions between the working class and the peasantry
, the contradictions between the workers and peasants on the one hand and the 
intellectuals on the other, the contradictions between the working class and 
other sections of the working people on the one hand and the national bourgeoisie
on the other, the contradictions within the national bourgeoisie, and so on.' 
In Mao's analysis, the people are anything but a small 'in-group' but rather
amount to over 90% of China's population at the time. What's more, as the title
suggests, Mao's speech is an articulation of a method for handling contradictions
among the people that does not involve use of the repressive apparatus (i.e. the
police, the army, etc.).

Much of what Mao discusses in 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among
the People' relies on the ontological framework that he outlined in his speeches
20 years earlier at the Anti-Japanese Military College in Yenan. As Mao pointed out
in 1937 in his speech 'On Contradiction', 'each and every difference already 
contains contradiction and[...]difference itself is contradiction.' Marx adapted the 
concept of contradiction from Hegelian metaphysics, recasting it in a materialist 
framework; Mao's works offer significant elaboration of
this concept and its theoretical relevance to political practice. In Mao’s 
articulation, each and every difference is a contradiction and every relation is
contradictory. Thus, there is no unity  which is not the unity of two 
contradictory and unevenly related elements: ‘Contradiction and struggle are universal
and absolute, but the methods of resolving contradictions, that is, the forms of 
struggle, differ according to the differences in the nature of the contradictions. 
Some contradictions are characterized by open antagonism, others are not.’

The question of the place of antagonism in contradiction is a question of the relation
between the two sides of a contradiction. If the the two aspects of the 
contradiction can coexist, in difference, without the destruction of their
contradictory relation then the contradiction is non-antagonistic. Thus when Mao
speaks of correctly handling contradictions among the people, he is 
outlining the means to handle non-antagonistic contradictions in a manner
that prevents them from becoming antagonistic. This method of handling contradictions
is necessary for resolving contradictions among the people. Without correctly
differentiating between antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions there
is no possibility of progressing towards communism, that is, the elimination
of the conditions of possibility of inequality and the destruction of 
the value form.

In 'On Contradiction' Mao offers an explanation of how contradictions
between different social classes can develop into antagonistic
contradictions: 'In human history, antagonism between classes exists as
a particular manifestation of the struggle of opposites. Consider the 
contradiction between the exploiting and the exploited classes. Such 
contradictory classes coexist for a long time in the same society, be it
slave society, feudal society or capitalist society, and they struggle 
with each other; but it is not until the contradiction between the two 
classes develops to a certain stage that it assumes the form of open 
antagonism and develops into revolution.' In the context of revolutionary
politics, the resolution of the antagonistic contradiction between
proletariat (understood as a political class) and bourgeoisie (and those
who take a politically reactive stance) is resolved either through the 
destruction of the revolutionary political organization of the proletariat
(and thus a continuation of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie) or the 
creation of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The later entails 
replacing the organs of bourgeois state power with those of a different 
kind and the sustaining of proletarian subjective force. 

The dictatorship of the proletariat thus serves to prevent the restoration
of bourgeois order (by internal or external enemies) as well as to spur
the initiative of the people to put politics (and not economics) in command
so that existing contradictions can be resolved through political interventions
(and not mediated through statist mechanisms of social control). 
Mao is clear that among the people
this involves discussion and principled ideological struggle against backwards 
political ideas, and not the use of the repressive apparatus. In 1957, even members
of the national bourgeoisie are included in Mao's use of the term 'the people',
which, against class-reductionism, speaks to the need to analyse contradictions
in the concrete context in which they exist. As Mao puts it, 'in the concrete 
conditions of China, this antagonistic contradiction between the two classes [the
working class and the national bourgeoisie], if properly handled, can be transformed
into a non-antagonistic one and be resolved by peaceful methods. However, the 
contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie will change
into a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy if we do not handle it properly
and do not follow the policy of uniting with, criticizing and educating the national
bourgeoisie, or if the national bourgeoisie does not accept this policy of ours.'
Thus Mao also outlines the primacy of class stand (the subjective) over social class
(the objective) in politics. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, even the
national bourgeoisie is capable of taking a proletarian class stand and playing
a positive role in the socialist revolution.

This nuanced analysis of the situation in China stands in sharp contrast to Fan's
claim that Mao 'effectively painted the world in black and white, banishing 
diversity, difference, or considerations of civil liberty.' Instead of a reductionist
simplification of the situation in China, Mao offers a detailed analysis that
outlines the complex structure of social relations in China at the time. Based
on this analysis, he provides a means to promote the proletarian political unity of the 
people while working to resolve contradictions in a non-antagonistic manner. In addition,
in 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People' Mao is
criticizing those who would use the repressive apparatus against the people instead of 
the democratic method of discussion and debate. 11 years later in a meeting with Red Guard 
leaders and members of the Central Group of the Great Proletarian Cultural
Revolution Mao reiterates this point, '“April 14” [one of the Red Guard Factions] has a 
theoretician by the name of Chou Ch’uan-ying. Why should we arrest a theoretician? He is 
a theoretician for a school of thought. He writes articles. Why should you
[Nie Yuanzi, a leader of a rival Red Guard faction] arrest him? Release him. He has 
his opinion. Let him write again! Otherwise, there will be no freedom.' 

The example of the Red Guards is one of the most important examples of how,
despite the antagonisms that developed between various factions in Beijing,
the correct handling of contradictions among the people was able to resolve
the antagonistic contradiction without use of the repressive apparatus.2
[footnote detailing this development or do I include it in the body?] Even 
if anatagonistic contradictions among the people can be handled correctly 
and resolved without use of the repressive apparatus, the question remains,
in what circumstances is it necessary to employ the repressive aparatus, 
to exercise the 'dictatorship of the proletariat'? 

### Enemies, External and Internal

Fan's analysis of Mao's 'worldview', as we have already argued, relies on 
a fundamental ambiguity, which is not an accident, but rather completely
necessary to sustain the theoretically consistency of her comparison between
Mao and Trump. Despite significant abstraction from concrete details
Fan must rely on certain points of comparison, and it is precisely
at these points that her argument falters upons symptomatic
points of inconsistency that bely the foundational axioms of her thought. A 
thorough examination of these axioms reveals them to be metaphysical in nature,
positing external causes as the basis for change, principal among them the 
supposedly undivided unity of consciousness.

One such point of comparison between Trump and Mao is the distinction between friend and enemy which Fan identifies
in both of their thought. This is paired an empiricial observation of Trump's 
popularity in contemporary China, which implicitly supports Fan's thesis, and 
is deployed in a complex rhetorical argument: 'in China the appeal of ChuanPu, 
the Chinese rendering of Trump’s name, is readily apparent. From the start, 
Trump’s campaign relied on a core constituency of beleaguered blue-collar 
voters—“the people,” Mao would have surely termed them—whose economic distress 
he masterfully channelled toward the creation of loathsome villains, the enemy.
The ease with which Trump erected and proselytized this divide speaks to what 
the Chairman would have labelled a ripeness for “class struggle.”'

The implication is that, for people in China, the popularity of Trump in the U.S.
is explained by common sense; their past experience with Maoism 
showed them how poor and working class people can be tricked (by a charismatic
and bombastic leader) into believing that their socio-economic difficulties are 
caused by some 'enemy'. Fan's view is that all 'enemies' are just boogey-men 
invented by the elite to serve their own interests and channel the frustrations 
of those who are less well off. She is clear that it was
Trump himself who 'erected and proselytized this divide' between friend and enemy.
Fan fails to specify whether the economic distress of the working class
is the result of objective processes outside of human control, or simply due to 
their own laziness, but she is clear that any attempt attribute it to any enemy 
whether it be the bourgeoisie (a term symptomatically absent from her writing)
or illegal immigrants is just demagoguery.

This sort of manipulation of working class people is only possible because of
the how 'masterfully' Trump was able to erect the fetish of the enemy which
has come to stand in for all of the problems that the working class face under
contemporary capitalism. What is at stake in this claim is the nature of mastery.
If an enemy of the working class does not exist, then any discussion of this enemy
is the creation of a figure of mastery. In Fan's ideology of bourgeois individualism
mastery is embodied in the individual who manipulates (less educated) others for 
his/her own personal gain. 

At the degree of abstraction necessary to sustain Fan's comparison, the 
question of the nature of 'the enemy' in the thought of Mao and Trump cannot
be posed. Any concrete comparison of the category of 'the enemy' in Mao and 
Trump's respective discourses would show the essential differences between 
the two and thus erode the basis for comparison. Instead, Fan must remain at
the level of abstract equivalence, which is supported by her assumption that,
with a (bourgeois) democracy, there are no real enemies (except perhaps Trump 
and those who support his 'totalitarian' campaign). This, however, presents
Fan with the problem of explaining the reason for the existence of antagonistic
contradictions within society. Her answer is that these 
contradictions are parlor tricks on the part of a ruling elite to further their
own interests. She thus assumes that the contradictions in society are reflections
of the power-struggles of various individuals. In this metaphysical worldview the
elite (masters) rule and social struggles follow the power struggles of the elite. 
In light of these assumptions, the best sort of politics are those that establish
rules that limit the power of the powerful.

In Fan's view the majority of people cannot grasp this or other abstract concepts and
thus are suseptible to being conned by someone like Trump. She is quite 
clear about this, 'Abstract principles, which Hillary Clinton 
has been known to proclaim in China—of human rights and women’s rights—seem
less relevant than the practical economic challenges facing the average 
citizen.' 

This sort of disdain for the average person is dressed up in the aesthetics
of intellectualism, but is actually a direct consequence of Fan's assumption
that the conflicts in society are reflections of the power-struggles of the
ruling elite. If the contradictions in society are caused
by the contradictions in the minds of the elite, then the best type of government
is one in which there is a just ruler who supports principles such as
'human rights and women's rights'. Thus the care of the meak and helpless
is the charge of the benevolent ruler and those enlightened intellectuals
who support her/him.

This worldview stands in sharp contrast to
that of Mao, who called upon party cadre to go live amongst the masses
and to concentrate the correct ideas of these masses to carry forward the 
revolution in China. Mao repeatedly struggle against the view of those
like Fan who believed that it is the elite (and not the masses) make
history. In 1968 when meeting with the Central Group for the Cultural
Revolution met with the leaders of various Red Guard factions, Mao said,
'People are saying the “social struggle is a reflection of the struggle
within the Party Central Committee.” It is not that social struggle is a
reflection of the Party Central Committee. Rather, the struggle within the
party Central Committee is a reflection of social struggle.' Mao's thought
thus stands in stark contrast to Fan's bourgeois idealism and the assumption
that it is individual power struggles that determine social relations. 

Mao's views also stand in contrast to the economic determinism of those like
Stalin and Trotsky who posited that the telos of History was the driving 
force of proletarian politics. In contrast to this metaphysical view of
the necessity of History as the external motive force of politics, Mao
repeatedly emphasized that it is the masses that make history (and not 
History that makes the masses). Understanding the primacy of internal
contradictions amongst the masses a the basis for change is the crux
of the dialectical materialist world outlook that Mao puts forward and 
develops under the name Marxism-Leninism. In contrast to Fan's 
representation of Maoism, Mao was not a figure of mastery, working to
manipulate the masses to serve his own self interest. Nor did he claim 
to have 'the answers'.

However, it should be noted that there were many on among the ultra-'left' 
who wanted to claim that Mao had the 'correct ideas' and the answers to
resolve the social conflicts in China. These ranged from Yang Xiguang (
who in 1968
was the 18 year old leader of Shengwulien, an ultra-'left' mass organization
of over a million people in Hunan province that referred to Mao as the 'the 
great supreme commander of the proletariat' and called for the complete 
overthrow of the CCP) who, after the Cultural Revolution became a professor
of neo-classical economics, to Lin Biao a member of the Cutural Revolution
Small Group who claimed that Mao's sentences were worth 10,000 times as much
as those of a normal person, only to latter plot against Mao and die in his
attempt to flee to revisionist Soviet Union. After his death Lin, became the
target of the political campaign to 'Criticize Lin, Criticize Confuscious' 
(批林批孔运动) because his insistence on the absolute correctness of Mao's
words was a form of metaphysical dogmatism akin to Confuscious' insistence
on the divine correctness of the Chinese Emporer.

More then all of this, the aforementioned discussion with the Red Guard leaders
in 1968 is indicative of Mao's opposition to the portrayal of him as a master
with 'the answers'. Chen Boda, another member of the Cultural 
Revolution Small Group, instructed the Red Guard leaders to 'follow the 
Chairman's instructions closely; act resolutely in accordance to them.' To 
which Mao responded 'do not say that I am giving "instructions"'. In 
contradiction to the 'great man' understanding of history, Mao repeatedly
emphasized that 'it is the masses that make history', which speaks to the
subjective capacity of the people themselves to play the leading role in
politics and qualitatively transform the world.

This view stands in contrast to shared asumptions of the right and 
ultra-'left' which both emphasize the individual as the locus of social
contradictions and struggles.


[go on to question of enemies]

In order to sustain this thesis
Fan has to posit the existence of an undivided unity of consciousness

(go on to axiom that there are no enemies)

Fan assumes that politicians harness people’s frustration with 
conditions such as poverty for their own personal ends. These 
frustrations are instrumentalized on the part of politicians, 
and aimed at a given group of people, labeled the enemy. Closely
related to this assumption are two more. First that of bourgeois
intentionality where contradictions in the external world are 
reflections of internal self-interested struggles for power 
amongst individuals, specifically the elite. Second, that the 
working-class and those less educated than the average reader 
of The New Yorker are ignorant of these struggles for power on 
the part of the elite. Or, more bluntly that most people are 
stupid and can’t grasp abstract ideas, instead focusing on the 
basic issues in front of them. 

Fan says as much, ‘Abstract principles, which Hillary Clinton 
has been known to proclaim in China—of human rights and women’s
rights—seem less relevant than the practical economic challenges
facing the average citizen.’ This is written in the context of 
Fan’s discussion of the support for Trump amongst Chinese citizens
(based on one opinion poll). Thus, Fan is not explicitly critiquing
American Trump supporters for being unable to grasp ideas like 
‘human rights and women’s rights’, but insofar as the article 
is series of reflections between China while Mao was alive, the 
U.S. today, and China today (with Weimar Germany unmentioned, but
present in its absence) a reader is quickly led to the conclusion 
that Americans who support Trump do so because they are narrow-minded
misogynists who have been seduced by Trump’s bombastic polemics into
believing that his election will lead to the resolution of their 
economic woes (most likely through the expulsion of various immigrant
populations). The implication is that this simpletons are so worried
about the economic issues that they are facing that they remain
ignorant of the violations of civil liberties that Trump would
perpetrate if elected. 

This logic leads one to conclude that behind Trump’s bombastic 
speeches is the threat of the destruction of American democracy
itself, grounded as it is in bourgeois legality and the discourse 
of rights. The threat of the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship
in the U.S. is, in Fan’s view, apparent in Trump’s popularity itself: 
‘America’s embrace of an abrasive showman who threatens to fracture a 
major party is a reminder that the infirmities of a Western democracy 
may not be entirely different from those of a Chinese socialist 
plutocracy.’ This thesis is in line with that of Mark Singer, Fan’s 
colleague at The New Yorker. In his most recent book he has described 
Trump as a ‘potential threat to America’s standing as a rational 
guardian of the world order.’ In my view it is assumptions like those 
of Fan and Singer that are much more dangerous, positing as they do a 
metaphysical dualism between totalitarian and democracy, the effectively 
function as apologies for the oppression and exploitation constitutive 
of capitalism. Through equating Trump to Mao, Fan assumes that all there
is and ever can be is maneuvering on the part of the political elite,
and the best that we can hope for is a good official (like Hai Jui, or
Hillary Clinton) who will defend our abstract freedom through promoting
legal rights. Any struggle for egalitarian change (i.e. the resolution 
of the economic distress of the working-class) is written off in advance
as doomed to end up in totalitarian dictatorship, and all of this is 
equated with Donald Trump’s campaign for president.

In order to get a better idea of the reductive re-presentations in Fan’s
description of Mao’s thought, it is necessary to examine On the Correct 
Handling of Contradictions Among the People.

That is to say, if Trump is elected, the U.S. might become a bit more 
like the ‘socialist plutocracy’ in China. Perhaps through the establishment
of a single party system, and thus through the destruction of the foundation
of the U.S.’s bourgeois democracy. This conclusion is in line with fellow 
New Yorker writer Mark Singer’s warning that Trump is a ‘potential threat 
to America’s standing as a rational guardian of the world order.’ If 
	

In, 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'
Mao puts forward a method by which it is possible to handle contradictions 
among the people so as to avoid both a bureaucratic and a repressive
surpression of the democratic rights of the people: 'The only way to settle
questions of an ideological  nature or controversial issues among the people
is by the democratic method, the method of discussion, criticism, persuasion
and education, and not by the method of coercion or repression.' Mao's words 
stand in sharp contrast to the the dominate anti-communist narrative, repeated
by Fan, that the dictatorship of proletariat in China was a repressive system
that served a small group of elites and silenced all dissent. Rather than 
labeling a small 'in group' as 'the people' and using the repressive apparatus
to crush any and all opposition to their interests, Mao spoke of the need 
to understand the complexities of contradictions among the vast majority of 
people in China, and to handle these contradictions, which included dissenting
views, with care so as to prevent the becoming antagonistic of non-antagonistic
contradictions. As Mao puts it, 'In ordinary circumstances, contradictions
among the people are not antagonistic. But if they are not handled properly, 
or if we relax our vigiliance and lower our guard, antagonism my arise.' 
Concretely, this means avoiding the 'Left' deviation of mistaking 'certain 
contradictions among the people for contradictions with the enemy'.

[This section needs to be put somehwere else in the paper or generally 
reorganized]


metaphor for the
nature of antagonistic contradictions: 'Before it explodes, a bomb is
a single entity in which opposites coexist in given conditions. The 
explosion takes place only when a new condition, ignition, is present. 
An analogous situation arises in all those natural phenomena which finally 
assume the form of open conflict to resolve old contradictions and produce
new things.'



'In human history, antagonism between classes exists as a particular manifestation of the struggle of opposites. Consider the contradiction between the exploiting and the exploited classes. Such contradictory classes coexist for a long time in the same society, be it slave society, feudal society or capitalist society, and they struggle with each other; but it is not until the contradiction between the two classes develops to a certain stage that it assumes the form of open antagonism and develops into revolution. The same holds for the transformation of peace into war in class society.

Before it explodes, a bomb is a single entity in which opposites coexist in given conditions. The explosion takes place only when a new condition, ignition, is present. An analogous situation arises in all those natural phenomena which finally assume the form of open conflict to resolve old contradictions and produce new things. '

During this 
period the Chinese Communist Party had allied with the Guomindang (GMD- Chinese
Nationalist Party) in a United Front against the Japanese imperialist 
invasion of northern China. In these speeches Mao elaborated on the basis for
allying with the GMD and understanding that, given the Japanese invasion, the
GMD could be considered a tenative 'friend'. At the time Mao explained the basis 
for this unity: 'In the present period of the anti-Japanese war, the Kuomintang 
stands in contradiction to Japanese imperialism and wants co-operation with the 
Communist Party, without however relaxing its struggle against the Communist Party
and the people or its oppression of them. As for the Communist Party, it has always,
in every period, stood with the great masses of the people against imperialism and 
feudalism, but in the present period of the anti-Japanese war, it has adopted a 
moderate policy towards the Kuomintang and the domestic feudal forces because the 
Kuomintang has pressed itself in favour of resisting Japan.' Thus, through a certain 
handling of 

guomindang






[Maybe this is the place to discuss the question of reflection of contradictions] 
The entirety of Fan’s argument rests on this point: that there is no such 
thing as an enemy that is not make-believe (except, perhaps totalitarian 
demagogues). The workers problem’s are of their own creation, and any 
discussion of class (social or political) is just a duplicitous trick on 
the part of various individuals in their efforts to further their own 
political power. 

Yet, Fan’s articulation remains ambiguous, who is this imaginary enemy at
which Trump is channeling the anger of the working class? Fan states that
‘the ease with which Trump erected and proselytized this divide speaks to
what the Chairman would have labelled a ripeness for “class struggle.”’ 
However, Trump does not employ the Marxist terminology of class, himself being
a businessman of substantial wealth. Nor does Trump speak, as Mao and Lenin 
did of foreign imperialist powers as the enemy of oppressed people (or, more 
accurately, an enemy amongst others). Actually, there remains a fundamental 
ambiguity Fan’s re-presentation of Trump’s articulation of the nature of 
the enemy in question. Yet this is perhaps an accurate representation of 
Trump’s political rhetoric. Yet, from this Fan concludes that it is Trump 
himself that ‘erected and proselytized’ this divide between the working-class 
and their enemies. That is to say, that any discussion of an enemy is little
more than a parlor trick, with no basis in an objective analysis of a situation.

This is a foundational axiom of Fan’s thought.
It is the basis for the comparison between Trump and Mao. If any discussion 
of an enemy of the working-class is just a Schmittean creation on the part 
of the ruling elite to further their own personal interests. But, all of this 
begs the question: In Maoism, are ‘the people’ just  ‘the in crowd’ as determined
by Mao and the elite to further their own power? In order to answer this, we turn
to On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People. This essay is 
slightly modified transcript of a speech that Mao gave in 1957 during an 
anti-Rightest campaign within the Party. Mao begins the document by demarcating
between contradictions among the people and contradictions between the people 
and the enemy, clarifying that these two types of contradiction “are totally 
different in nature.”2

Rather, what we find in Trump’s rhetoric is a what Fan refers to as ‘the 
matter of Trump’s race-baiting, scapegoating, and bigotry against Mexicans,
Muslims, and the general immigrant population.’ Thus it would seem that, 
on a basic level, there are some significant differences between Mao’s 
articulation of the enemy in terms of socio-economic class and imperialist
oppression, and Trump’s fetishization of ‘the general immigrant population’
as the source of the problems of the blue-collar working class. 

Fan speaks to this at the end of her article when she states “America’s
embrace of an abrasive showman who threatens to fracture a major party 
is a reminder that the infirmities of a Western democracy may not be entirely
different from those of a Chinese socialist plutocracy.”

“Trump logic, as twisted as it is effective, may also explain why 
fifty-four per cent of respondents in a poll conducted by Global Times, 
a state-sponsored Chinese paper, supported Trump, versus only forty per 
cent of Americans who do.”
